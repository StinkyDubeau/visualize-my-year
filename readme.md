A day tracker that visualizes data using p5js.

Todo:
- When logging in, auto-create a table for "currentUser" if one doesn't exist.

Abandoning this project for now!

I struggled to figure out a schema for the database, and I'm not sure it's worth my time right now. I got a good framework out of this though! Check out p5node.
